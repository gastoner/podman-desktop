## Release details üîç

### Podman v5.5

Podman Desktop aims to work offline, so it ships alongside its binary, the Podman executable.
In this release, the latest Podman 5.5 version provides new features, bug fixes, and better stability while using the tool.

You can find the full changelog of Podman 5.5 on their release page [containers/podman/releases#v5.5.0](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases/tag/v5.5.0).

:::info

While the Podman binary is updated in this release, the existing Podman machines will remain at the version in which they were created. To update your Podman machine, you must remove it and initialize a new one.

:::

### Bootc Extension ü¶≠

The Podman Desktop Boot container extension (aka Bootc) has recently seen significant improvements; one of them is the usage of [macadam](https://github.com/crc-org/macadam).

> Macadam is a cross-platform command-line tool to create and manage virtual machines. It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and uses each OS's native virtualization stacks: WSL2 on Windows, Apple‚Äôs Virtualization Framework on macOS, and QEMU on Linux. Macadam reuses Podman machine code.

As the bootc tool applies a container image as an update to an already running Linux system, allowing the output to boot an entire OS with the container image included. To test the bootc artifact, you either need a dedicated machine or create a virtual machine from the artifact.

To simplify the developer experience of testing the artifact,
the Podman Desktop Bootc extension offers you a way to directly create a virtual machine from the artifact you created.

<br/>

:::note

There is a known issue with the virtualization that can be found in the [bootc extension readme](https://github.com/podman-desktop/extension-bootc?tab=readme-ov-file#known-issues).

:::

Another important aspect of presenting a new technology is showcasing its capabilities. Thanks to [Charlie Drage](https://github.com/cdrage) and [Tim deBoer](https://github.com/deboer-tim), a lot of effort has been put into demonstrating bootable containers, such as kernel module management, WiFi modules, systemd unit files, and others.

You can find ready-to-use examples on the **Bootable Containers > Examples** page.

### AI Lab ‚ú®

The Podman Desktop AI Lab extension started as an experiment in 2024, exploring how AI workflows could be containerized,
celebrating more than one year of updates and progress, the extension has grown to support a wide range of tools,
such as Instructlab[^64], llamaCPP[^65], WhisperCPP[^69] and with the latest release OpenVINO, llama-stack and MCP.

#### OpenVINO

With the introduction of OpenVINO[^67] as a supported inference runtime, you can now run OpenVINO models[^68] locally through Podman.

<OptimizedImage

darkSrc={useBaseUrl('/img/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.19/extension-ai-lab-openvino-dark.png')}
/>
<br/>

#### llama-stack

Llama Stack standardizes the core building blocks that simplify AI application development[^71].

With the latest version of AI Lab, we introduce support for Llama Stack, running in a containerized environment. Inference servers running inside AI Lab will be registered to the Llama Server to be used by their clients.

darkSrc={useBaseUrl('/img/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.19/extension-ai-lab-llama-stack-dark.png')}
/>
<br/>

#### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Creating a product from LLMs has proven challenging, and emerging protocols are trying to help, such as MCP.

> MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs.[^70]

The initial steps to support MCP in the AI Lab playground have begun, enabling developers to experiment directly through the GUI before trying to integrate it into their applications.

### Minc extension üì¶

[MicroShift](https://github.com/openshift/microshift) is a project that optimizes OpenShift Kubernetes for small form factors and edge computing[^66]. Similar to [Kind](/docs/kind) and [Minikube](/docs/minikube), an extension for creating and managing MicroShift clusters locally through Podman has been created.

You can learn more about it in the [MicroShift](/docs/openshift/microshift) section.

### RHEL Lightspeed ‚ö°

Red Hat Lightspeed is a generative AI assistant integrated into Red Hat's hybrid cloud platforms, such as OpenShift and Enterprise Linux.[^100]
It provides natural language guidance within the console to simplify complex tasks, enhance productivity, and bridge IT skills gaps.

[^100]: [Red Hat Announces General Availability of Red Hat OpenShift Lightspeed to Supercharge Hybrid Cloud Productivity with Generative AI](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-announces-general-availability-red-hat-openshift-lightspeed-supercharge-hybrid-cloud-productivity-generative-ai)

Users can choose from various AI models, including OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, WatsonX, or deploy private models on Red Hat platforms.

With a Red Hat subscription, you can experiment with Red Hat Lightspeed from anywhere, including Podman Desktop, through a new extension called RHEL Lightspeed.

You can install the extension directly by navigating to the **Extensions > Catalog** page and clicking its **Install** icon.

/>
<br/>
<br/>

:::note

- If you are facing any authentication issues, ensure to use the [Red Hat Authentication](https://github.com/redhat-developer/podman-desktop-redhat-account-ext) extension.
- As this new extension just landed in the Podman Desktop extension catalog, you may share your feedback in the extension repository [redhat-developer/podman-desktop-redhat-lightspeed-ext](https://github.com/redhat-developer/podman-desktop-redhat-lightspeed-ext).

:::

### RHEL VMs extension üóÉÔ∏è

Through the Podman executable, Podman Desktop manages virtual machines; the cross-platform code responsible for this has been reused to create the macadam tool mentioned earlier.

The RHEL VMs extension helps the user run RHEL virtual machines using the macadam tool.

/>
<br/>
<br/>

:::note

On macOS and Linux, you need to manually install the Macadam binary. See [pre-requisites](https://github.com/redhat-developer/podman-desktop-rhel-ext?tab=readme-ov-file#pre-requisites) for more details.

:::

### RHEL 10 availability üö¢

The Podman Desktop you love - _simplified container management and intuitive UI_ - now extends to RHEL workflows.
For users on RHEL systems, explore the extension channel to install Podman Desktop. You'll get a familiar experience across Windows, Mac and now RHEL. Releases are happening at the same time as other platforms, so you'll get instant access to new features.
