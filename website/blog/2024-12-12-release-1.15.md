## Release Details üîç

### Improved Feedback Form üìù

In the 1.15 release, we introduced a redesigned feedback form to streamline issue reporting. With our growing user base,
it‚Äôs vital to provide a convenient way to submit feedback directly to GitHub via our main repository: [podman-desktop/podman-desktop/issues](https://github.com/podman-desktop/podman-desktop/issues).

While retaining our internal anonymous feedback system, this update also enables users to preview their issues on GitHub, ensuring better communication.

  }}
/>

#### Feedback Categories

We now offer three distinct feedback categories:

- **Direct your words to the developers**: Keeps feedback anonymous, visible only to our team.
- **Feature Request**: Redirects users to GitHub to suggest new features.
- **Bug**: Allows users to report bugs directly on GitHub.

  }}
/>

### Experimental Task Manager üîî

Back in the [0.13 release](/blog/podman-desktop-release-0.13#new-task-manager-1724), we introduced the Task Manager. With an increasing number of long-running tasks, we‚Äôve revamped it to improve usability. This updated version is available as an experimental feature!

#### Enabling the Experimental Task Manager

To try it out, go to `Settings > Preferences > Tasks` and enable the `Manager` option.

  }}
/>

#### What‚Äôs New?

Key changes include:

- Enhanced usage of available screen width.

  }}
/>

### Kubernetes Events üìú

This year, we‚Äôve been steadily adding Kubernetes capabilities to Podman Desktop. While this effort is ongoing,
version 1.15 introduces support for [Kubernetes Events](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/event-v1/).
These events are now available for resources like Nodes, Services, and Pods.

  }}
/>

### SSH Access to Podman Machine

A frequent user request has been the ability to establish an SSH connection to a Podman machine for debugging or configuration purposes.
In this release, you can now directly connect to your Podman machine from its details page.
