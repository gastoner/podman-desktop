## Release Details üîç

### Experimental Features

Previous versions of Podman Desktop introduced some experimental features, which were activable from the Settings.

In Podman Desktop v1.16, these Experimental Features are visible in the new "Experimental" section of the Settings,
and dedicated Discussion pages have been created and can be accessed from this section.

  }}
/>

### Providers appear in the Status Bar

If you activate the Experimental feature "Statusbar Providers show Providers" (see section above), the providers will
display their status in the status bar.

Specifically, providers will display a status if they are providing at least one resource, and indicate with an icon what is the status
of their resources: running, or stopped.

In the screenshot below, the Podman provider indicates that the Podman machine is running, and the Kind provider indicates that the Kind cluster is stopped.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.16/provider-status-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Prune only untagged images

When clicking the "Prune" button in the Images List page, it is now possible to select which images you want to be pruned, either all unused images, or all untagged images.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.16/prune-images-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Search in Container's Logs

Logs output by containers can be very long, and you might want to search for a specific term on them. Podman Desktop v1.16 now provides this possibility for Podman containers, and for Kubernetes pods.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/blog/podman-desktop-release-1.16/logs-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Kubernetes: Monitor current context only

Previous versions of Podman Desktop are trying to connect to all Kubernetes contexts found in the kubeconfig file to display how many Pods and Deployments
exist in each context.

Many users raise that this is problematic. For example, some users have many contexts defined in their kubeconfig, and connecting to all of them can be considered as spamming by clusters.

Other users have contexts pointing to clusters hosted by cloud providers, and connecting to these clusters needs a periodic refresh of a token authentication.
Users (or users tools) generally take care of having a fresh token for the current context, but not necesserally for the other ones. The operation of refreshing the token being, for some configurations, designed for CLI tools and not GUI tools, Podman Desktop fails to indicate to the user that this token should be refreshed, and tries infinitely to connect.

In Podman Desktop version 1.16, the number of Pods and Deployments are displayed only for the current context, and the user can select manually for which other contexts these numbers should be displayed.
